## Overview

The purpose of this edge API is to connect LMS such as Sakai and Blackboard (LTI Platforms) to Folio via the [LTI Advantage](https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview) protocol for the purposes of sharing the course reserves stored in Folio.

To accomplish this, this module acts as an LTI Tool Provider. It adheres to two parts of the LTI Advantage spec to accomplish this. First, security is enabled via a [third-party-initiated OIDC Authentication flow](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#platform-originating-messages) (this is a generic ). Second, the actual course reserves are requested and shown via messages using [the Resource Link spec](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/#resource-link-launch-request-message).

The general use flow is as follows:

1. Upon navigation to the tool's page on an LMS such as Sakai (the LTI platform), the platform sends an OIDC login initiation request to the tool at a predefined URL.
1. This request is handled in `LtiCoursesHandler::handleOidcLoginInit`. The request is parsed and validated.
1. If the request is valid, it responds with an HTTP 302 Redirect to a preconfigured URL for that platform.
1. The platform handles that redirect and bounces a request back to the tool to the tool launch endpoint with the LTI request itself.
1. The tool parses the LTI request which contains info about which course is being viewed in the LMS. Based on that, it fetches the course and its reserves from mod-courses, renders them in HTML, and sends back the HTML.
1. The platform takes the response and displays it in an iframe.

## Configuration

Configuration is done in two ways. Values common to Folio Edge modules are configured using the methods made available in [edge-common](https://github.com/folio-org/edge-common). These handle things like the `port`, `okapi_url`, or `secure_store_props`.

Other parameters defined this way include:

- `lti_tool_private_key_file`: The path to a private key in PEM format. It is used to sign the JWTs that the tool creates.
- `lti_tool_public_key_file`: The path to a public key in PEM format. It is used to create a JWKS endpoint.

### LTI Platforms

LTI Advantage requires that Platforms and Tools have knowledge of one other before they can safely and effectively communicate. This Tool is configured with the platforms it should respond to via the [`ui-lti-courses`](https://github.com/doytch/ui-lti-courses) module. More information about what is configurable can be found there, but at a minimum, this Tool needs to know the following about a platform:

- Client ID: The ID that was generated _for the Tool_ by the Platform.
- Issuer: Corresponds to the `iss` field in a JWT sent by the Platform.
- JWKS URL: A location where the Tool can fetch the Platform's JWKS so that it can decode the JWTs sent and signed by the Platform.
- OIDC Authorization URL: The URL that the Tool should redirect the Platform to after handling an OIDC Login Initiation.
- Search URL: A templated URL that the Tool will use when rendering HTML links to the course reserve items.

## Security

[edge-common](https://github.com/folio-org/edge-common) contains a description of the security model as it relates to the `apiKey`. Additionally, further security is added due to LTI's use of an OIDC login flow.

### apiKey

In my testing the most bulletproof method of passing the `apiKey` was as a path param, e.g., `https://my-server.edu/lti-courses/launches/myApiKey`, rather than a query or header param because some LMSs expect to have exclusive use of the query params and insert a second `?` in the URL.

### LTI RSA256 Keys

LTI uses RSA256 encoding for its JWT messages. This tool requires the LTI platform's public key to verify the JWTs it receives, and a private key with which to sign the responses it sends back to the platform.

#### Tool Keys - Autogenerated

This Tool can generate its own keys via `java.security.KeyPairGenerator`. This is the default use case if nothing else has been configured. The tool's public key is available as a JWKS via the `/lti-courses/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint. If a Platform can be configured with a tool's JWKS endpoint, this is likely the simplest method of configuration.

#### Tool Keys - Pregenerated

Some LMSs/LTI Platforms do not support JWKS endpoints for a Tool. If your Platform generates tool keys or requires an externally-generated tool key, you can set this Tool's keys via the `lti_tool_private_key_file` and `lti_tool_public_key_file` configuration parameters, e.g., `java -Dlti_tool_private_key_file resources/private.pem ... -jar ...`

#### Platform Keys

The Platform's public key is specified via the [`ui-lti-courses`](https://github.com/doytch/ui-lti-courses) module by configuring a Platform's JWKS URL.
